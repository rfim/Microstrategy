<P CLASS="Body">Once a report or document has run, there are several ways to interact with it to make analysis easier.</P>

<P CLASS="Body">In non-full screen mode, a header shows the back button, report/document name, and the currently displayed group of data.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">Switch between metrics in a grid by tapping their titles.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">Business data may be grouped (in a page-by) across the top of a report or document. To view another group, tap the currently displayed group of data and choose another group, or swipe horizontally at the edge of the screen to move between groups.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">To zoom in or out of a report or document, perform a pinch.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">Some reports or documents can be viewed in either a landscape or portrait orientation. Depending upon how the report or document was designed, you can change this orientation by rotating your device.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">Some reports or documents allow you to view information at multiple levels. For example, a report may display time at the year level by default, but may be able to display data grouped by quarter or month. Tap an object to view its information on a different level.</P>
